# react-aria-tabpanel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/react-aria-tabpanel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/react-aria-tabpanel)

A React component that helps you build *accessible* tabs, by providing keyboard interactions and ARIA attributes described in [the WAI-ARIA Tab Panel Design Pattern](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel).

Please check out [the demo](http://davidtheclark.github.io/react-aria-tabpanel/demo/).

## Project Goal

A React component that provides a style- and markup-agnostic foundation for fully accessible tab panels. *You provide the inner elements: this module gives you "smart" wrapper components that will handle keyboard interactions and ARIA attributes*.

**If you think that this component could be even more accessible, please file an issue.**

If you like this kind of module (accessible, flexible, unstyled, with framework-agnostic low-level modules) you should also check out these projects:
- [react-aria-modal](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-modal)
- [react-aria-menubutton](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-menubutton)

## Installation

```
npm install react-aria-tabpanel
```

Dependencies:
- react 0.14.x
- react-dom 0.14.x
- [focus-group](//github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group)

The modular approach of this library means you're much better off building it into your code with a module bundling system like browserify or webpack.

But if you need a UMD version (which will include `focus-group`, but of course not React), you can get it via npmcdm at `https://unpkg.com/react-aria-tabpanel@[version-of-choice]/umd/ariaTabPanel.js`.
If you don't know about unpkg, [read about it here](https://unpkg.com).

## Usage

```js
var AriaTabPanel = require('react-aria-tabpanel');

// Now use AriaTabPanel.Wrapper, AriaTabPanel.TabList,
// AriaTabPanel.Tab, and AriaTabPanel.TabPanel ...
```

## Examples

Have a look at the code in `demo/js/` for varied examples.

## API

The AriaTabPanel object exposes four components: `Wrapper`, `TabList`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel`. Each of these is documented below.

**`TabList`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel` must always be wrapped in a `Wrapper`.**

### `Wrapper`

A simple component to group a `TabList`/`Tab`/`TabPanel` set, coordinating their interactions.
*It should wrap your entire tab panel widget.*

All `TabList`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel` components *must* be nested within a `Wrapper` component.

Each wrapper should contain *only one* `TabList`, *multiple* `Tab`s, and *multiple* `TabPanel`s.

#### props

All props are optional.

**onChange** { Function }: A callback to run when the user changes tabs (i.e. clicks a tab or navigates to another with the arrow keys). It will be passed the the newly activated tab's ID.

By default, the tabs maintain state internally. *Use this prop to make the tabs "stateless," and take control yourself.* You can run any arbitrary code when the user performs an action that indicates a tab change (e.g. change your route and update a store, etc.).

Stateless tabs may make sense if you want to manage the tab's state in a Redux store, for example.

**letterNavigation** { Boolean }: If `true`, the tabs can be navigated not
only by arrow keys, but also by letters. This library uses
[focus-group](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group), so you
can read about how letter-key navigation in that module's ["String Searching" docs](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group#string-searching).

**activeTabId** { String }: Directly tell the tabs which one is active. By default, the first tab provided will be the initially active tab, and from then on the active tab state is managed internally. This prop, then, can be used two ways:

- to give the tabs an initial active tab other than the first, or
- if you have seized control of the state (via an `onChange` function), to continuously tell the tabs which one is active.

**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'div'`.

*Any additional props (e.g. id, className, data-whatever) are passed directly to the HTML element.*

### `TabList`

Wrap the `Tab`s with a `TabList`.

A `TabList`'s children should be React elements.

#### props

All props are optional.

**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'div'`.

**role** { String }: The `role` attribute for the element. Default: `'tablist'`. The parameter is useful when you have want the same interaction as tabs but want screen readers to describe the content differently.

*Any additional props (e.g. id, className, data-whatever) are passed directly to the HTML element, unless TabList needs them itself.*

### `Tab`

The active tabs is focusable. Inactive tabs are not.

You can switch from one tab to another by clicking with the mouse or using the arrow keys.

A `Tab`'s children may be any of the following:

- A string
- A React element
- A function accepting the following tab-state object:
  ```js
  {
    isActive: Boolean // self-explanatory
  }
  ```

#### props

All props are optional except `id`.

**id** { String } *Required.* The id attribute for this element and the
identifier that ties this `Tab` to its `TabPanel`
(so there should be a `TabPanel` component with a matching `tabId`).

**active** { Boolean }: If you are controlling the state yourself (with an `onChange` function on your `Wrapper`),
use this prop to tell the `Tab` whether it is active or not.

**letterNavigationText** { String }: If you are using letter-key navigation
(having turned it on via the prop on `Wrapper`), you
can use this prop to specify this `Tabs`'s searchable text.
By default, the element's `textContent` is used â€” which is
usually what you want.

**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'div'`.

**role** { String }: The `role` attribute for the element. Default: `'tab'`. The parameter is useful when you have want the same interaction as tabs but want screen readers to describe the content differently.

*Any additional props (e.g. className, data-whatever) are passed directly to the HTML element, unless Tab needs them itself.*

### `TabPanel`

The content area for your tabs. The active tab panel is visible; the inactive tab panels are not.

A `TabPanels`'s children may be any of the following:

- A string
- A React element
- A function accepting the following panel-state object:
  ```js
  {
    isActive: Boolean // self-explanatory
  }
  ```

#### props

All props are optional except `tabId`.

**tabId** { String }: *Required.* The id of the `Tab` that corresponds
to this `TabPanel`.

**active** { Boolean }: If you are controlling the state yourself (with an `onChange` function on your `Wrapper`),
use this prop to tell the `TabPanel` whether it is active or not.

**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'div'`.

**role** { String }: The `role` attribute for the element. Default: `'tabpanel'`. The parameter is useful when you have want the same interaction as tabs but want screen readers to describe the content differently.

*Any additional props (e.g. className, data-whatever) are passed directly to the HTML element, unless TabPanel needs them itself.*
